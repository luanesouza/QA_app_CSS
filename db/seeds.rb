Answer.create(answer: 'False! Only 17% of the 1.4 Million people in the E.U studying Tech are Women. This statistic, from a survey carried out in 2015, shows again the reality of the inequality in the tech industry. This inequality is detrimental to the recruitment of new females into the industry but also to the future of tech. An industry can only prosper to its full potential learning from diversity in the work force and a proper representation of the population within the discipline.', question_id: question2.id )

Answer.create(answer: 'True. Both men and women interrupt women more often than they interrupt men, according to a paper published in 2014 in the Journal of Language and Social Psychology. In that study, two researchers at George Washington University reported on an experiment where they put 20 women and 20 men in pairs, then recorded and transcribed their conversations. The result: Over the course of each three-minute conversation, women interrupted men just once, on average, but interrupted other women 2.8 times. Men interrupted their male conversation partner twice, on average, and interrupted the woman 2.6 times.', question_id: question4.id)

Answer.create(answer: 'True. Not always True. But a 1998 meta-analysis of 43 studies by two researchers at the University of California at Santa Cruz from 1998 found that men were more likely to interrupt women with the intent to assert dominance in the conversation, meaning men were interrupting to take over the conversation floor.  In mixed groups rather than a one-on-one conversation, men interrupted even more frequently.', question_id: question5.id)

Answer.create(answer: 'False. Men get more space in print and online journalism. Men donâ€™t just talk more in face-to-face conversations, but in our media conversations too.', question_id: question6.id )
